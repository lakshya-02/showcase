# Furnito

## Overview

**Furnito** is a mixed-reality VR/AR interior design and warehouse training application built during **HackSRM 7.0**. The project enables users to design and modify 3D spaces using natural voice commands instead of manual drag-and-drop interactions.

By leveraging real-time speech-to-text processing, Furnito converts spoken instructions into actionable spatial logic that dynamically generates and positions 3D assets inside a Unity environment. This approach helps architects, designers, and warehouse planners rapidly prototype layouts, reduce material waste, and visualize spatial arrangements before physical implementation.


## Key Features

- 🎤 **Voice-Driven Scene Editing**  
  Users can create and modify environments using natural speech commands.

- 🧠 **Real-Time Speech-to-Text Integration**  
  Powered by ElevenLabs API for accurate and low-latency transcription.

- 🏗️ **Procedural 3D Asset Generation**  
  Dynamically spawns and positions furniture or structural elements based on interpreted commands.

- 🕶️ **VR/AR Compatible**  
  Designed for immersive use with XR devices such as Meta Quest.

- 📦 **Warehouse Training & Interior Planning**  
  Supports layout planning, training simulations, and rapid prototyping workflows.



## How It Works

1. **Voice Capture**  
   The user speaks commands inside the VR/AR environment using a microphone-enabled device.

2. **Speech-to-Text Processing**  
   The audio stream is sent to ElevenLabs' API, which converts speech into text in real time.

3. **Command Parsing & Intent Recognition**  
   The transcribed text is analyzed to determine:
   - Object type (e.g., chair, table, shelf)
   - Placement instructions (e.g., next to wall, center of room)
   - Transform properties (scale, rotation)

4. **Dynamic Scene Generation**  
   Corresponding prefabs are instantiated and positioned within the Unity scene.

5. **Immediate Spatial Feedback**  
   Users can walk around and interact with the updated environment instantly in VR/AR.


## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)** – Real-time 3D engine and spatial interaction logic  
- **ElevenLabs API** – Speech-to-Text processing  
- **XR SDK / Meta Quest Support** – Immersive mixed-reality deployment  
- **REST API Integration** – Backend communication for transcription services  



## Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lakshya-02/HackSrm
cd HackSrm
````

### 2️⃣ Open in Unity

* Install Unity (2021 LTS or later recommended)
* Open Unity Hub
* Click **Add Existing Project**
* Select the cloned project folder

### 3️⃣ Configure API Access

* Add your ElevenLabs API key in the appropriate configuration script.
* Ensure microphone permissions are enabled.

### 4️⃣ Run the Project

* Open the main scene from `Assets/Scenes`
* Click **Play**
* Begin issuing voice commands to generate spatial assets

## Demo

Add:

* Screenshots of the VR interface
* Voice-to-asset generation examples
* A short demo video showcasing real-time spatial modification

## Future Plans

* Advanced natural language understanding for more complex spatial relationships
* Multi-user collaborative design sessions
* AI-assisted semantic placement recommendations
* Expanded asset libraries and environment presets
* Full AR passthrough optimization for real-world spatial mapping
